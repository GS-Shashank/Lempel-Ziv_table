# Lempel-Ziv_table Author: Shashank G S

Lempel–Ziv–Welch is a universal lossless data compression algorithm created by Abraham Lempel, Jacob Ziv, and Terry Welch. The LZW algorithm is a very common compression technique. This algorithm is typically used in GIF and optionally in PDF and TIFF. Unix’s ‘compress’ command, among other uses. It is lossless, meaning no data is lost when compressing. The algorithm is simple to implement and has the potential for very high throughput in hardware implementations. It is the algorithm of the widely used Unix file compression utility compress, and is used in the GIF image format.

This repositry contains the python code file. Which can produce the codewords for the string input.
